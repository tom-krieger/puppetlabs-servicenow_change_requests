# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Release 0.3.1

**Bugfixes**
- Fixes a bug in the order of parameters which would cause an error while waiting for the CI worker to finish associating the CIs with the Change Request, resulting in a `undefined method '[]' for nil:NilClass` error. To implement this fix, you need to replace the content in `site-modules/deployments` in your control repo with the contents in `files/deployments` of this module.

## Release 0.3.0

**Features**
- Adds support for OAuth authentication against ServiceNow
- Uses the Sensitive datatype for password & OAuth token inputs, which will mask the input in PE and CD4PE
- Adds official support for ServiceNow Rome
- Removes official support for CD4PE 3.x

## Release 0.2.3

**Features**
- Adds support for CD4PE 4.5.0

Note: CD4PE 4.5.0 changes a certain API call that is used by the ServiceNow Business Rule ("Puppet - Promote code after approval") that this module installs. If you have used a previous version of this module to install the Business Rule, you are required to re-run the `servicenow_change_requests::prep_servicenow` plan that this module provides. The plan will automatically update the ServiceNow Business Rule to account for the API change.

If you are running an older version of CD4PE than 4.5.0, you can still use this module, but you will need to specify an extra parameter to the `servicenow_change_requests::prep_servicenow` plan to ensure the older version of the Business Rule gets installed. To do so, set the `br_version` parameter of the plan to `0.2.2`. Once you upgrade to CD4PE 4.5.0, re-run the plan without specifying this parameter to upgrade the Business Rule.



## Release 0.2.2

**Features**
- Support for HTTP proxies (no authentication)

## Release 0.2.1

**Features**
- Quebec support. Note that this requires updating the custom deployment policy content in your control repo with the newer content provided by this module's update. 

## Release 0.2.0

**Features**
- The Business Rule in ServiceNow (for interacting with CD4PE) now automatically detects available MID Servers with a REST capability, and uses the first one available for outbound REST calls
- Risk and Impact fields in the Change Request are automatically set in accordance to the Impact Analysis verdict
- Now shows the name of the stage to promote toin the Change Request description, instead of the stage number

**Bugfixes**
- Now properly escapes special characters in commit descriptions, preventing an error when creating the Change Request
